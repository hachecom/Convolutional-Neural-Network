# Convolutional-Neural-Network
AI project created during my period working in PwC, year 2028. 
The idea was to train the CNN with job descriptions and labels for the position in search. The net would then predict what was a company looking for based on the position description. 
Results: 
CNN_3Labels: main label, mid label and sub label. 
CNN_2Labels: MAin lanel and sub label.
